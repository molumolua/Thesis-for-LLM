    # Equation of the hyperbola: (y - k)^2 / a^2 - (x - h)^2 / b^2 = 1
    # Solving for the x-coordinate of a given point_y

    # Rearranging for x^2:
    x_squared = b**2 * (1 + ((point_y - k)**2 / a**2))

    # Calculate x-coordinate
    x = math.sqrt(x_squared)  # Taking the positive root for simplicity
    # Calculate the sum h + k + a + b + x
    result = h + k + a + b + x
