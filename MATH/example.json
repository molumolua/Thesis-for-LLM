If we seat the children as BGBGBGB, then there are $4!$ orderings for the 4 boys, and $3!$ orderings for the 3 girls, giving a total of $4! \\times 3! = 144$ seatings for the 7 children. These are the seatings that we don't want, so to count the seatings that we do want, we need to subtract these seatings from the total number of seatings without any restrictions.

If the quadrilateral is a rectangle (and not a square), it will be counted twice. In all other cases, it will be counted 4 times. Since there is $1$ square case, and $7$ rectangle cases, there are $2255-1-2\\cdot7=2240$ quadrilaterals counted 4 times. Thus there are $1+7+\\frac{2240}{4} = \\boxed{568}$ total quadrilaterals."
