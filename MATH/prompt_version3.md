### 先提取问题中的premise
You are a Mathematics Expert in the field of extracting key information.
Your target is to extract key mathematical premises and the question  in one given problem.
The result in #Mathematical Premises#  MUST be the json array in the json format,each item in the array is a string describe the mathematical premise.
String in the result  MUST keep the same mathematical format and language specification as #Original Problem#.
You CANNOT omit the non-text parts such as the table and code in #Original Problem#:. Also, please do not omit the input in #Original Problem#.
You SHOULD complicate the #Mathematical Premises# and #Mathematical Question# using the following method:
Check each token in the problem and identify the definition part and question part of the problem in #Original Problem#.
Identify each premise in the definition part and append it into #Mathematical Premises#. 
Try you best to find the implied premise in the #Original Problem#. 
Each item in the list in #Mathematical Premises# MUST contain ONLY ONE mathematical premise.
Fill in the #Mathematical Question# with the question part.
Try your best to make sure we can reconstruct the problem using the extracted #Mathematical Premises# and #Mathematical Question#.
#Original Problem#:
<Here is instruction.>
#Mathematical Premises#:
#Mathematical Question#:




#Mathematical Premises#:

```json
[
    "The fifth term of a geometric sequence of positive numbers is $11$.",

### 细粒度提取每一步条件，方法，结论
You are a Mathematics Expert in the field of extracting key information in the process.
Your target is to extract the triple of {premises, method and conclusion} in each step of a given mathematical solution process in #Original Solution#.
The result in #Extract Triples#  MUST be a json array in the json format, and each triple in the array describes a single step in the process, including three attributes: premises, method and conclusion.
String in #Extract Triples#  MUST keep the same mathematical format and language specification as #Original Solution#.
You SHOULD make sure the triples are in the order of their appearances in the original solution. 
Strings in #Initial Premises# indicate the initial premise.
You SHOULD complicate the #Extract Triples# using the following method:
Check each step in the process of solution and extract detailed premises, method and the conclusion.
Premises in LATER steps MUST be  conclusion in FORMER steps or #Initial Premises#.
FORMER conclusion are NOT ALLOWED to appear in LATER conclusion.
#Initial Premise#  are NOT ALLOWED to appear in conclusion.
The conclusion in each triple SHOULD contain ONLY ONE mathematical result.
You SHOULD check the connection between each step in #Original Solution# and reflect the connection in the exacted triples.
The method in each triple is ONLY ALLOWED to use information in corresponding premises in the same triple.
All the calculation MUST be done in the method in each triple.
The conclusion should describe clearly the meaning of the method and avoid being verbose.
The final conclusion in the #Extract Triples# MUST be the answer to the #Original Question#.
Try your best to make sure we can reconstruct the solution only using #Extract Triples#.
#Initial Premises#:

### evolve triples
You are a Mathematics Expert in writing a continuation of mathematical process.
Your target is to construct ONE json object in the #Constructed Triple# including three attributes: premises, method and conclusion to extend the #Process Triples#.
The constructed triple MUST be in the same form of the object in #Process Triples#.
You SHOULD complicate the #Constructed Triple# using the following method:
The premises of the #Constructed Triple# MUST contain the conclusion of the LAST triple in  #Process Triples#, while premises in #Initial Premises# and other conclusions of #Process Triples# are optional.
You can add at most ONE assumption in the premises to make the whole process more coherent.
The method of #Constructed Triple# is ONLY ALLOWED to use information in the premises of the #Constructed Triple#.
The method of #Constructed Triple# MUST treat the conclusion of the LAST triple in #Process Triples# as key information and extend the conclusion, while treating other premises as side information.
ANY assumption, supposition, new scenario or new case is STRICTLY forbidden in The method of #Constructed Triple#.
All the calculation MUST be done in the method of #Constructed Triple#.
The conclusion should describe clearly the meaning of the method and avoid being verbose.
You MUST generate ONE mathematical malleable conclusion with a simplified number WITHOUT approximation in the conclusion of #Constructed Triple#. 
Adding #Constructed Triple# to #Process Triples# SHOULD push the whole process into a more complicated one for AI systems.
Try your best to make sure each triple in original #Process Triples# is indispensable for the final conclusion in #Constructed Triple#.
"#Constructed Triple#","constructed triple" is NOT ALLOWED to appear in the answer.
#Initial Premises#:

在前序步骤都给出的情况下仍然计算错误，应该是受到了想求目标的不确定性影响。

两个问题：
- 从何处断开？ 甚至其实只取一个片段都是可以的。（这里我是人为观察出来的，有些问题的求解步骤是类似的或者有共性，类似于数列求解，会求首项、公比等等，这种求解步骤适合往后延申。有些步骤是问题特化的，例如求解第八项的数值，如果是问题特化的结论，感觉很难进化。应该“变异”换成一个更难的特化问题？）
  - 如何判断两种不同的步骤？其实有很大一部分问题可以说是完全特化的，例如鸡兔同笼问题，共性问题往往有一个解题模板，几何问题等等。
- 尝试能否让大模型先生成下一步想求的目标，再生成计算过程。(问题导向，这样可以把所有已知结论转化成条件，说不定从特化结论中也能获取一些新的信息)


我们应该把问题步骤分成两种来考虑，或者我们直接对任何问题都采用两种方式，然后消除进化失败。



### 尝试
<!-- - 第一种：给出所有的条件（到最后一个步骤之前，solution揭露了条件之间的关系（用或者不用？）），再给出原问题和一个单triple，让他变异成一个更加高级的问题，这个更高级的问题具体需要一个更加高级的技巧，可以补充初始条件（给一些假设，或者直接增加条件）
- 上述的方法我们可以从每一个中间结论中开始变异（把中间结论转化成问题）
- 第二种：给出所有的条件（包括最后一个步骤），没有原问题，让他延申继续生成问题。
- 上述方法也可以直接断开，也就是evolve triples中的方法稍微改一下，先生成问题，再用结论回答。（可以补充条件） -->


- 尝试先生成问题，再生成solution。
- 这样就可以避免之前出现的问题，并且我们可以从很多不同的地方断开进行这样的操作，然后消除进化失败。
