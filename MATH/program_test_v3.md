A steer weighs 200 kilograms and consumes 150 liters of water per day. If the weight of the steer is converted to pounds and the water consumption is converted to gallons, what is the ratio of water consumed per pound of body weight? Round your answer to the nearest thousandth.
```
def solution():
    # Given values
    steer_weight_kg = 200  # weight in kilograms
    water_consumed_liters = 150  # water consumed in liters per day

    # Conversion factors
    kg_to_pounds = 2.20462  # 1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds
    liters_to_gallons = 0.264172  # 1 liter = 0.264172 gallons

    # Convert weight to pounds and water to gallons
    steer_weight_pounds = steer_weight_kg * kg_to_pounds
    water_consumed_gallons = water_consumed_liters * liters_to_gallons

    # Calculate the ratio of water consumed per pound of body weight
    ratio = water_consumed_gallons / steer_weight_pounds

    # Round the result to the nearest thousandth
    return round(ratio, 3)

A farmer needs to convert the weight of a steer from kilograms to pounds for a livestock report. The weight of the steer is 200 kilograms. However, the farmer wants to account for precision in the conversion process and applies a logarithmic correction to the result. The conversion factor from kilograms to pounds is based on a precise constant of 1 kg=2.2046226218487757 lbs.
After applying the correction, the farmer rounds the final weight to the nearest whole pound. What is the corrected weight of the steer in pounds?

A farmer has a steer that weighs 200 kilograms. The farmer needs to estimate the weight of the steer in pounds and calculate the total cost of feed based on the steer’s weight. The cost of feed is $0.12 per pound of body weight. How much does the steer weigh in pounds (rounded to the nearest pound), and what is the total feed cost for the steer?
```
def solution():
    # Given weight of steer in kilograms
    weight_kg = 200

    # Conversion factor from kilograms to pounds
    kg_to_lb = 2.20462

    # Convert weight to pounds
    weight_lb = weight_kg * kg_to_lb

    # Round to the nearest pound
    weight_lb_rounded = round(weight_lb)

    # Cost of feed per pound of body weight
    cost_per_pound = 0.12

    # Total feed cost
    total_cost = weight_lb_rounded * cost_per_pound

    return weight_lb_rounded, total_cost

- 不太符合我们的期望。我认为破开条件这个可能对程序来说稍微为难了一些，要他破开前面某个条件再用一些内容去生成。
- 尝试再调优，实在不行可以放弃破开条件
