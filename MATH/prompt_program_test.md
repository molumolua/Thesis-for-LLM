# 从program中反写问题
You are a Mathematics Expert in the field of question reconstruction.
You target is to reconstruct the question based on corresponding python program solution.
You should fill the quesion part using following method:
You should mainly follow the relationship between variables and true value of variable symbols to reconstruct the question.
You MUST check the information in the program detailedly and make sure we can solve the question with the program.
You can add side infomation about real situation to make the problem semantically coherent. 
Here are three examples how to do it.
```
def solution():
    money_initial = 23
    bagels = 5
    bagel_cost = 3
    money_spent = bagels * bagel_cost
    money_left = money_initial - money_spent
    result = money_left
    return result
```
Question: Olivia has $23. She bought five bagels for $3 each. How much money does she have left?

```
def solution():
    golf_balls_initial = 58
    golf_balls_lost_tuesday = 23
    golf_balls_lost_wednesday = 2
    golf_balls_left = golf_balls_initial - golf_balls_lost_tuesday - golf_balls_lost_wednesday
    result = golf_balls_left
    return result
```
Question: Michael had 58 golf balls. On tuesday, he lost 23 golf balls. On wednesday, he lost 2 more. How many golf balls did he have at the end of wednesday?

```
def solution():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result
```
Question: There were nine computers in the server room. Five more computers were installed each day, from monday to thursday. How many computers are now in the server room?

How about this python program?
```
import math
def solution():
    total_ways = math.factorial(7)
    
    daughter_arrangements = math.factorial(3)
    boy_positions = math.comb(4, 4) * math.factorial(4)  # Place all 4 boys in the 4 gaps
    no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways = daughter_arrangements * boy_positions
    
    result = total_ways - no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways
    return result
```
Question:
# 进化问题
尝试给它指定方向进化
- 数值增强（增大数值）
- 逻辑增强（elseif增多、判断条件增加、while、for的停止条件增强）
- 循环增强（增加循环层数）
- 计算增强（设计一些更强的关系来统计计算,增加一些计算式、更高级的method去计算一个问题）
- 代码增长

- 我们在写问题的时候应该把问题的逻辑也写在备注里，这样让他自然形成合理的代码，
- 我们自己编几个上下文示例，
  - 指导生成备注和代码
  - 指导增强过程

## 数值增强
You are a Programming Expert in the field of rewriting python program.
You target is to rewrite one python program to make it evolve into a bit more difficult one for AI systems to handle.
The python program aims to solve one mathematical question, and the variable names indicate their actual meaning.
You should fill the #Rewritten Program# part using following method:
You should rewrite the #Given Program# and evolve it by enhancing its initial numerical values.
The enhanced values should make sure the generated result is difficult to  guess.
You should make sure the enhanced values ​​are consistent with common sense and logically reasonable.
You are NOT allowed to add new variable.
You should only write code blocks.
#Given Program#:
```
<Here is the program.>
```
#Rewritten Program#:


增强后的结果：
```python
#增强数值本身已经存在一定的风险性
#1 问题得符合现实的常识，每周不超过7天，都得是整数等等
def solution():
    computers_initial = 9
    computers_per_day = 7  # Increased the number of computers added per day
    num_days = 5  # Extended the period to 5 days (Monday to Friday)
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = computers_initial + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result

#2 有一些困难问题写成代码只能写成这种数值运算，增强数值之后不一定仍然正确的表达了含义。
import math
def solution():
    total_ways = math.factorial(10)
    
    daughter_arrangements = math.factorial(5)
    boy_positions = math.comb(6, 5) * math.factorial(5)  # Place 5 boys in the 6 gaps
    no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways = daughter_arrangements * boy_positions
    
    result = total_ways - no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways
    return result
```
## 逻辑增强
- 多增加一些不同的情况，特例等等
You are a Programming Expert in the field of rewriting python program.
You target is to rewrite one python program to make it evolve into a bit more difficult one for AI systems to handle.
The python program aims to solve one mathematical question, and the variable names indicate their actual meaning.
You should fill the #Rewritten Program# part using following method:
You should rewrite the #Given Program# and evolve it by enhancing the logical judgment conditions in the way of adding constraints.
The added constraints MUST correspond to mathematical conception.
You should make sure the enhanced logical judgment ​​are consistent with common sense and logically reasonable.
Using added constraints to make validations, checks, raising errors is FORBIDDEN in #Rewritten Program#. 
You are allowed to add new variables to make the whole program solution coherent and faithful.
Try your best to make sure the enhanced program aims to solve one definite question.
You should only write code blocks.
#Given Program#:
```
<Here is the program.>
```
#Rewritten Program#:

```python
def solution():
    initial_computers = 9
    computers_added_per_day = 5
    num_working_days = 4  # Monday to Thursday
    days_of_week = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']

    total_computers = initial_computers
    for day in range(num_working_days):
        daily_addition = computers_added_per_day

        # Adjust daily addition based on special conditions
        if days_of_week[day] == 'Wednesday':
            # On Wednesday, add extra 3 computers as a special promotion
            daily_addition += 3
        elif days_of_week[day] == 'Tuesday':
            # On Tuesday, add only 4 computers due to budget constraints
            daily_addition = computers_added_per_day - 1

        total_computers += daily_addition

    # Ensure total is within reasonable limits (e.g., maximum 40 computers)
    max_computers_allowed = 40
    if total_computers > max_computers_allowed:
        total_computers = max_computers_allowed
    
    # Return the final total, ensuring no unrealistic overshooting
    return total_computers
#Question: There were 9 computers in the server room. Five computers were added each day from Monday to Thursday. However, due to budget constraints, only 4 computers were added on Tuesday, and a special promotion on Wednesday allowed 3 extra computers to be added that day. What is the maximum number of computers that can be in the server room by Thursday, considering a limit of 40 computers?

```

## 循环增强
- 我们在数学中一般不会使用循环，而是使用公式计算，这会使得一些问题可能在低循环的时候（1或者很少次）很容易计算，但是到高循环（1000，10000）时需要使用公式计算很难。
- 但是对于程序来说复杂程度并不会很高。
- 如果是增加循环layers，则会增加问题的复杂度。

    result = total_computers
    return result
