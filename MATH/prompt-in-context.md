You are a Programming Expert in the field of rewriting python program.
You target is to choose one evolutionary direction to make it evolve into a bit more difficult one for AI systems to handle.
You will be given serval evolutionary directions in #Evolutionary Directions# and ONE python programs in #Given Program#.
The python program aims to solve one mathematical question, and the variable names indicate their actual meaning.
You should make the decision using following method:
You should identify the controllablly evolvable and insufficient part of the program and find out the most suitable evolutionary direction from a mathematical perspective.
Make sure the program can evolve a little bit in the chosen direction.
Try your best to make sure we can conduct enhancement on the program to make it evolve into a coherent and logical one in the chosen direction with high success rate for AI systems like GPT4.
Try your best to make sure we can reconstruct one math question from the enhanced program.
You should choose ONLY ONE direction to evolve.
You should ONLY output the number of the directions.
#Evolutionary Directions#:
1.Enhancing its initial numerical values to make the problem difficult to guess.
2.Enhancing the logical judgment conditions in the way of adding constraints.
3.Increasing the number of loop layers to add one new dimension.
4.Continuing writing the program a bit further to generate further conclusion.
5.Applying a bit more advanced math techniques in the calculation process of the program.

You will be given serval evolutionary directions and corresponding examples in #Evolutionary Directions# and ONE python programs in #Given Program#.
The python program aims to solve one mathematical question, and the variable names indicate their actual meaning.
You should make the decision using following method:
You should identify the controllablly evolvable and insufficient part of the program and find out the most suitable evolutionary direction from a mathematical perspective.
Try your best to make sure we can enhance the program into a coherent and logical one in the chosen direction with absolutely high success rate for AI systems like GPT4.
You should choose ONLY ONE direction to evolve.
You should ONLY output the number of the directions.
#Evolutionary Directions#:
1.Enhancing its initial numerical values.
Initial Program:
```
import sympy as sp
def solution():
    # Define the symbols
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

    # Equation for the boundary of the shadow
    lhs = y + 3
    rhs = sp.sqrt(x**2 + (y + 1)**2 + 4)

    # Solve the equation y + 3 = sqrt(x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + 4)
    equation = sp.Eq(lhs, rhs)
    result = sp.solve(equation, y)

    return result
```
Evolved Program:
```
import sympy as sp
def solution():
    # Define the symbols
    x, y = sp.symbols('x y')

    # Enhanced equation for the boundary of the shadow
    lhs = y + 10
    rhs = sp.sqrt(x**2 + (y + 5)**2 + 25)

    # Solve the equation y + 10 = sqrt(x^2 + (y + 5)^2 + 25)
    equation = sp.Eq(lhs, rhs)
    result = sp.solve(equation, y)

    return result 
```
2.Enhancing the logical judgment conditions.
Initial Program:
```
import math
def solution():
    # Total number of ways to arrange 7 people without restriction
    total_ways = math.factorial(7)
    
    # Number of ways where no two boys are next to each other:
    # 1. Arrange 3 daughters in a row (3! ways)
    # 2. Place the boys in the gaps between the daughters (4 gaps) in a way such that no two boys are next to each other
    daughter_arrangements = math.factorial(3)
    boy_positions = math.comb(4, 4) * math.factorial(4)  # Place all 4 boys in the 4 gaps
    no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways = daughter_arrangements * boy_positions
    
    # The number of ways where at least 2 boys are next to each other
    result = total_ways - no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways
    return result
```
Evolved Program:
```
import math
def solution():
    # Total number of ways to arrange 7 people with the first place must be boys.
    total_ways = math.comb(4, 1) * math.factorial(6)
    

    # Number of ways where no two boys are next to each other with the first place must be boys:
    # 1. Arrange 3 daughters in a row (3! ways)
    # 2. Place the boys in the gaps between the daughters (4 gaps ) in a way such that no two boys are next to each other
    daughter_arrangements = math.factorial(3)
    boy_positions = math.comb(4, 4) * math.factorial(4)  # Place all 4 boys in the 4 gaps
    no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways = daughter_arrangements * boy_positions
    
    # The number of ways where at least 2 boys are next to each other and the first place must be boys.
    result = total_ways - no_boys_next_to_each_other_ways
    return result
```
3.Increasing the number of loop layers.
Initial Program:
```
def solution():
    initial_computers = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days = 4  # 4 days between monday and thursday
    computers_added = computers_per_day * num_days
    computers_total = initial_computers + computers_added
    result = computers_total
    return result
```
Evolved Program:
```
def solution():
    initial_computers = 9
    computers_per_day = 5
    num_days_week1 = 4  # 4 days between Monday and Thursday
    num_days_week2 = 3  # 3 additional days between Friday and Sunday
    num_weeks = 2  # The total number of weeks (2 weeks in this case)

    total_computers = initial_computers
    
    # Loop for first week (Monday to Thursday)
    for week in range(num_weeks):
        if week == 0:
            num_days = num_days_week1
        else:
            num_days = num_days_week2
        
        for day in range(num_days):
            total_computers += computers_per_day  # Add computers for each day
        
    # Final result calculation after all days
    result = total_computers
    return result
```
4.Continuing writing the program a bit further.
Initial Program:
```
import math
def solution():
    # Given values
    a_5 = 17  # fifth term
    a_11 = 8  # eleventh term

    # Calculate r^6
    r_squared = a_11 / a_5
    r_squared = r_squared  # r^6 = 8/17

    # r^3 is the square root of r^6
    r_cubed = math.sqrt(r_squared)

    # The eighth term is 17 * r^3
    result = a_5 * r_cubed

    return result
```
Evolved Program:
```
import math

def solution():
    # Given values
    a_5 = 17  # fifth term
    a_11 = 8  # eleventh term

    # Calculate r^6
    r_squared = a_11 / a_5  # r^6 = 8/17
    r_squared = r_squared  # This is r^6

    # r^3 is the square root of r^6
    r_cubed = math.sqrt(r_squared)

    # The eighth term is 17 * r^3
    eighth_term = a_5 * r_cubed

    # Calculate the first term using the general geometric progression formula
    # a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)
    # Using a_5, we can find a_1
    a_1 = a_5 / (r_cubed ** 4)  # a_5 = a_1 * r^4 => a_1 = a_5 / r^4

    # Compute the sum of the first six terms (S_6) in the geometric progression
    S_6 = a_1 * (1 - r_cubed**6) / (1 - r_cubed)  # Sum of first 6 terms of geometric progression

    # Calculate the difference between the sum of first six terms and eighth term
    result = S_6 - eighth_term

    return result
