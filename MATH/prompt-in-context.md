You are a Mathematics Expert specializing in question reconstruction.

Your goal is to reconstruct the original mathematical question based on a corresponding Python program solution. The reconstructed question should restore the problem's background as much as possible and retain the difficulty involved in obtaining the initial variable assignments.

Follow the method below to complete the #Question 4# section:

1. Analyze the #Given Program 4# thoroughly, focusing on the relationships between variables and their actual values.
2. Reconstruct the problem background and context based on the information inferred from the program.
3. Ensure that the complexity and difficulty of initial variable assignments are preserved in the reconstructed question.
4. Ensure that the reconstructed question can be solved using the provided program.
5. DO NOT include ANY part of the solution process, including formulas, equations, or calculation methods in the #Question 4#.

You are a programming expert specializing in rewriting Python programs.

Your goal is to slightly transform a given Python program to make it marginally more complex and challenging for AI systems to handle, while still solving a reasonable and well-defined mathematical problem.

The Python program solves a specific mathematical question, and the variable names clearly represent their intended meaning.

Follow the method below to complete the #Rewritten Program# section: 
1. Rewrite the #Given Program# by adding new code in the begining of the program, making the original program a part of the enhanced program.
2. The addition of new code should first remove the direct definition of the randomly chosen initial variable and then  add new step(s) to compute the value of the eliminated variable.
3. Introducing new variables as needed to perform the addition is allowed.
4. Ensure that the numerical values of every calculated intermediate variable strictly follow the type constraints corresponding to their actual meaning.
5. Ensure that the rewritten program allows for the reconstruction of a meaningful mathematical question based on its solution.
6. The addition of program should correspond to ONLY ONE mathematical step.
7. ONLY return ONE variable and the name MUST be "result".
8. Provide only code blocks.

    total_computers = initial_computers
    
    # Loop for first week (Monday to Thursday)
    for week in range(num_weeks):
        if week == 0:

    return result
```
4.Continuing writing the program a bit further.

    a_11 = 8  # eleventh term

    # Calculate r^6
    r_squared = a_11 / a_5
    r_squared = r_squared  # r^6 = 8/17

    # r^3 is the square root of r^6
    r_cubed = math.sqrt(r_squared)

    # The eighth term is 17 * r^3
    result = a_5 * r_cubed

    return result
```
Evolved Program:
```
import math

def solution():
    # Given values
    a_5 = 17  # fifth term
    a_11 = 8  # eleventh term

    # Calculate r^6
    r_squared = a_11 / a_5  # r^6 = 8/17
    r_squared = r_squared  # This is r^6

    # r^3 is the square root of r^6
    r_cubed = math.sqrt(r_squared)

    # The eighth term is 17 * r^3
    eighth_term = a_5 * r_cubed

    # Calculate the first term using the general geometric progression formula
    # a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)
    # Using a_5, we can find a_1
    a_1 = a_5 / (r_cubed ** 4)  # a_5 = a_1 * r^4 => a_1 = a_5 / r^4

    # Compute the sum of the first six terms (S_6) in the geometric progression
    S_6 = a_1 * (1 - r_cubed**6) / (1 - r_cubed)  # Sum of first 6 terms of geometric progression

    # Calculate the difference between the sum of first six terms and eighth term
    result = S_6 - eighth_term

    return result
