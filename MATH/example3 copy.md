"problem": "In a certain hyperbola, the center is at $(2,0),$ one focus is at $(2,6),$ and one vertex is at $(2,-3).$  The equation of this hyperbola can be written as\n\\[\\frac{(y - k)^2}{a^2} - \\frac{(x - h)^2}{b^2} = 1.\\]Find $h + k + a + b.$",
"level": "Level 3",
"type": "Intermediate Algebra",
"solution": "The center of the hyperbola is $(h,k) = (2,0).$  The distance between the center and one vertex is $a = 3,$ and the distance between the center and one focus is $c = 6.$  Then $b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 6^2 - 3^2 = 27,$ so $b = 3 \\sqrt{3}.$\n\nTherefore, $h + k + a + b = 2 + 0 + 3 + 3 \\sqrt{3} = \\boxed{3 \\sqrt{3} + 5}.$"

这个结论o1、4o都计算和生成的不一样，4o检查说我的计算结果没有问题，o1说有一处用反了。我暂且认为o1说的是对的，这个结论是错误的。
