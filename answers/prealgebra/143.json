    "answer": "Firstly, the median for three numbers is the second number when the numbers are arranged in order. Therefore, the largest number would be 27+5=32.\n\nSecondly, the arithmetic mean (average) is the sum of all three numbers divided by the total number of numbers, which here is three. So we can set up an equation: (smallest number + 27 + 32) / 3 = 26.\n\nSolving this equation for the smallest number, we get: smallest number = 26*3 - 27 - 32 = 78 - 27 - 32 = 19.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is 19."
